jStudioClassic11
jStudioClassic11 represents a minor update of legacy Jet3D applications -- so they can run in a Windows 11 environment.
Except for a few minor instances of code polishing, no revisions have been made.

Jet3D was developed in the late 1990s. In its time, this software was at the forefront of "game engine" development and innovation. Serious development efforts stopped in or around 2005. 

The jStudioClassic11 work presented with this upload is part of an effort to curate Jet3D as an old-school "game engine" -- as a museum artifact so that young enthusiasts can experience the early stages of 3D game development. 

You are free to edit the code and build your own versions. But beware. The code is very fragile. This is not a system that will support code polishing, much less feature additions. 

Enjoy,
