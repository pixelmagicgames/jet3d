tStudio3d11
tStudio3d11 represents a minor update of all tStudio3d applications -- so they can run in a Windows 11 environment.
Except for a few minor instances of code polishing, no revisions have been made.

tStudio3D was created as an experimental development toolset using Genesis3D, for Windows. tStudio3D includes a custom implementation of Genesis3D including a BSP world editor (tDesigner3D), a scene editor (tDirector3D) and a distribution shell (tDeployer3D). tDirector3D can create unique, stand alone scenes by importing wavefront *.obj meshes, Genesis3D *.bsp files, *.wav sounds, *.mp3 music, and Genesis3D *.act actors. All imported resources are managed in tDirector3D through a plugin system of control panels. tDirector3D scenes then can be distributed and viewed fullscreen with tDeployer3D.
Enjoy,
